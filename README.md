Relearning JS from scratch from Javascript: Definitive Guide 5th Edition

All code snippets run on node command-line. Node version is not important, as long as ECMAScript 5 is implemented (which is all versions of Node)
```
node <JSfileName>
```

*Some of the later code snippets require [chalkJS library](https://davidwalsh.name/chalk). Download it using ```npm``` command like this*

```
npm install --save chalk
```

Most of the javascript demonstrates javascript concepts which I thought were unique to Javascript, (I am coming from a Java background) and which I think are really interesting and important.
